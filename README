This project is created to build a cyclic hanoi simulator in LEGv8. In this repo there are 3 files:
- README
- cyclicHanoiDriver.s
- cyclic_Hanoi.py
- cyclicHanoiDriverEC.s

In the python file we wrote a quick pythong script that counts the number of moves it should take us to perform cyclic hanoi on n disks. We just need to enter the input n in the last line of the script

In the .s file is the actual LEGvv8 code. There is a line commented as //n=3 where we add the value of n to x4. The script performs a count operation to determine the number of moves it should take one to perform cyclic hanoi and then actually performs the cyclic hanoi with a bunch of redundancy steps to show what it actually is without optimisation.

In the cyclicHanoiEC.s file we commented out our code that does the simulation and just run the procedure for n=16. And it correctly counts the number of moves it would take. This is very fast!
